### Instructions

Create a script that loops through all the stocks for each quarter and outputs the following information:

* The ticker symbol
* Quarterly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given quarter to the closing price at the end of that quarter.
* The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given quarter to the closing price at the end of that quarter.
* The total stock volume of the stock. The result should match the following image:

* Add functionality to your script to return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease", and "Greatest total volume". The solution should match the following image:

* Make the appropriate adjustments to your VBA script to enable it to run on every worksheet (that is, every quarter) at once.

**note**Make sure to use conditional formatting that will highlight positive change in green and negative change in red.

### Other Considerations

* Use the sheet `alphabetical_testing.xlsx` while developing your code. This dataset is smaller and will allow you to test faster. Your code should run on this file in just a few seconds.
* Make sure that the script acts the same on every sheet. The joy of VBA is that it takes the tediousness out of repetitive tasks with the click of a button.

### Requirements

#### Retrieval of Data (20 points)

* The script loops through one quarter of stock data and reads/ stores all of the following values from each row:
  * ticker symbol (5 points)
  * volume of stock (5 points)
  * open price (5 points)
  * close price (5 points)

#### Column Creation (10 points)

* On the same worksheet as the raw data, or on a new worksheet all columns were correctly created for:
  * ticker symbol (2.5 points)
  * total stock volume (2.5 points)
  * quarterly change ($) (2.5 points)
  * percent change (2.5 points)

#### Conditional Formatting (20 points)

* Conditional formatting is applied correctly and appropriately to the quarterly change column (10 points)
* Conditional formatting is applied correctly and appropriately to the percent change column (10 points)

#### Calculated Values (15 points)

* All three of the following values are calculated correctly and displayed in the output:
  * Greatest % Increase (5 points)
  * Greatest % Decrease (5 points)
  * Greatest Total Volume (5 points)

#### Looping Across Worksheet (20 points)

* The VBA script can run on all sheets successfully.

#### GitHub/GitLab Submission (15 points)

* All three of the following are uploaded to GitHub/GitLab:
  * Screenshots of the results (5 points)
  * Separate VBA script files (5 points)
  * README file (5 points)
